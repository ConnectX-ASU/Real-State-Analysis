# Real-State-Analysis
Are you curious about what factors really drive the prices of homes ? We also were. that's why we decided to  conduct an exploratory data anaylsis project so we can get answers.


Our goal is to identify the key features that most affect the house pricing, not only to satisfy our curiosity but also that we can assist in making informed decisions for buyers,sellers and investors.

We choose to apply our studies on data from the usa real estate market, so we can almost generalize the results over the global market, as we dived into data of  more than 1.4 milion properties across 19 states and more than 3k cities.
